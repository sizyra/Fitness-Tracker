Clone the repository using the link (https://github.com/sizyra/Fitness-Tracker.git), then use your CLI to run "npm install" and, when all dependencies are installed, run "node server.js" to start your server.

## Errors
I unfortunately couldn't get my Mongo Atlas database to properly connect to my application, despite following the provided instructions as best I could. Screenshots of the relevant pages can be found in the additionalImages folder of this repository.

## Usage
Once you've got the app running, your only option should be to click a button that says "Add a workout!" Select this and enter the workouts you've completed, either Cardio or Resistance. You can enter multiple workouts by clicking "Add Exercise" once all information is entered. 

When you're done, click "Complete" to finish adding. This will return you to the main page which now displays some stats. For graphs and more info, click "Dashboard" on the top left. To return to the home page, click "Fitness Tracker" on the top left. Enjoy!
